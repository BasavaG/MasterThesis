# MasterThesis : Investigation of Object Detection in Urban Traffic using Edge Computing
This repository contains the codes and notebooks used for master thesis. 
# Abstract:
Many hardware companies are driving towards building smart cameras with alternative
edge devices. The core business impact is to manufacture cost-effective state-of-the-art
(SOTA) vision systems. The concept of SOTA vision systems are versatility, dependability,
compact in size, cost-effective and consumes minimal power. The players in this
technological drift are devices such as; Googleâ€™s Coral Edge TPU and OpenCV AI KIT.
The devices have proved to deliver a favourable quality to inference neural networks models
efficiently. The current research in the domain has many cumbersome tasks and unsolved
questions. Combining the latest neural network topologies with the hardware is one of the
open research questions.
